StayCMS is a very simple php CMS framework.
It is very new, in alpha release.
More information is available at http://katmore.com/sft/staycms

Specs:
The StayCMS Content Management System will never require database connectivity.
It consists of a set of php classes, and an implementation of these classes.
Classes are implemented through unique site configuration of a theme namespace, and content namespace.

Documentation:
Because documentation is incomplete, the best thing is to
start by editing sf-config.php. It is well annotated.
The sample content packaged by default is designed to be informative to the site editor.
For maximum benefit, toggle viewing the sample content files directly, 
 then view their output as it appears in the browser and under 'view-source'.
For now, direct all questions to info_no_spam@katmore.com.

How it works:
An implementation of classes uses a configuration and decides state information.

The initial setup typically goes like this:
1) expand package
2) edit sf-config.php appropriately
3) edit/add to content as appropriate
4) edit template as seen fit

A full feature wish-list is yet to be published.
Many specs and features might be broken in any given alpha release.
