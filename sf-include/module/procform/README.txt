ProcForm is an extention of the sf-Form module.

It obtains and organizes HTTP POST/GET values for safe use;  typically for
processing HTML forms. Because of the generalized nature of sf-ProcForm, it is
simple to implement. It isn't as runtime efficent or compared to extending the
sf-Form module.

This is because ProcForm has to have extra error handling and searching 
capability that wouldn't otherwise have to exist. Yet it serves as a safe and
quick way to create form processing routines.

Notice how input values are made persistent between submission requests, and 
default values and names can be easily configured for all different types of
inputs. This is where ProcForm can elimiate the need for tedious form handling
code, which is where it can save on development time.
